a tree sits in our living room again
we’re all still alive but different; ask how my year’s been
there’s a few folks missing; it’s got me thinking
how many more decembers do we have

the carpet’s full of needles but we kinda like it
no snow again this year i guess that’s just how it is
i hold my breath a moment; brace for the next
how many more decembers do we get

someone left a jacket on the the back porch in the rain
i keep meaning to move it but it kinda looks like them
and when the breeze hits just right well i’m choking up again
how many more decembers has it been

this year she picked a calendar with pictures of the coast
thought it’d be sentimental, like i need another dose
it doesn’t even look like that, they ruined it in post
how many more decembers will we know

i half remember winters with the snow up to my waist
and nobody could leave for at least a couple days
and everything was quieter, dampened by the gray
and i didn’t feel cold i felt alive in the best way
something in the stillness made the world feel okay
how many more decembers
